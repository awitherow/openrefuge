> welcoming refugees with open arms

The aim of this site is to create a portal for refugees to find information they need to maneuver their life situation as effectively as possible. It also aims to connect supporters and trusted organizations who have the highest positive impact on aiding the refugees in this global crisis.

## tech stack

- [vue](vuejs.org) for frontend
- [vue-router](https://router.vuejs.org/en/) for routing
- [vue-i18n](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/started.html) for translations

# install dependencies
yarn install (npm run install)

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080

# build for production with minification
